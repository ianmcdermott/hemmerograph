# Mechanical Hemmer-O-Graph
## Museum: Hirshhorn
## Activitiy: Maker Mornings

## Project:
Creating a Public Engagement activity to explain the technology used in Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i>
Exhibit at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, I created an X-Y plotter
that uses heartbeats as its inputs. A Play on the word Harmonograph and the Artist's last name. 
Activity occured every Saturday at the museum from 10am-1pm in December 2018. 
Geared toward families with young children, but open to any museum-goer.

Building on the idea of generative bio-art of Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i> exhibit, 
I developed a few applications using similar ideas. With the finger pulse sensor used in the <i>Pulse Tank</i> 
installation, two visitors at a time take their individual beats per minute, which are then used used as 
variables, processed by a Lissajous algorithm, which produces a pattern based on the inputs. 
The application draws the pattern in realtime, currently in two formats, as lightening bugs and as dotted 
lines. In this way, visitors are able to create an abstract two-person portrait.
